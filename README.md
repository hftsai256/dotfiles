# Dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

# Status
Refactoring the previous `dotfiles` repository, which was forked and slightly modified from
https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles

You may see lots of "things" remains inside this repository as they're not cleaned up yet

# Install
Easy-peasy one-liner (just like oh-my-zsh)

`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hftsai256/dotfiles/master/bootstrap/stage.sh)"`
